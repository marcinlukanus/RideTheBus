### Description

Everyone's favorite ending to the their favorite drinking game is riding the bus. For when you want to drink but don't have a deck of cards (but still some self-respect), RideTheBus is a javascript web app created with VueJS to let you have the most fun you could have while drinking alone!

This originally started as a simple after-work project right when Covid-19 started and has grown into something that my friends and I are able to play while talking to each other online. Since then, I have rewritten the app in React Native and published it on the Google Play Store (and hopefully the Apple App Store eventually).

### Current Features

Right now the project is solely based on VueJS with a random cards being generated via some functions and displayed via Google's free-to-use card images. Buttons and game logic help users play the game without effort. A score counter keeps track of how many times you've redrawn, great for seeing which of your friends is the master of the bus!

### Future Features

-   I hope to fix the styling issue that prevents the cards from stacking vertically when on a phone. The goal would be to have it [mimic](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oGDRZvLCE4JC0b5YOC-cX9MTm6cqm-Q9HsAo7ontKocvoeBTMrg4Ii831jV23R-RiWE=w720-h310-rw) the Android app version of this game's landscape mode.
